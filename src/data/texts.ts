  "I speak concerning the abode of my Father which He hascommanded and given you the grace to build for Him. Hold not back every effort with your being to make this a reality. At this time, you cannot fathom the importance and usefulness of this building in your land, but I tell you, when this is done, you shall know heaven on earth. his Temple shall be greater and more powerful than the one built by King Solomon; and the news of this shall overshadow the whole world. By these words of mine, I call upon you to be a partaker of this command, and you shall live forever. I am Jesus Christ.";
