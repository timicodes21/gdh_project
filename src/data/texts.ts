  "I speak concerning the abode of my Father which He hascommanded and given you the grace to build for Him. Hold not back every effort with your being to make this a reality. At this time, you cannot fathom the importance and usefulness of this building in your land, but I tell you, when this is done, you shall know heaven on earth. his Temple shall be greater and more powerful than the one built by King Solomon; and the news of this shall overshadow the whole world. By these words of mine, I call upon you to be a partaker of this command, and you shall live forever. I am Jesus Christ.";

  " The Great Divine Holy Order of the Third Era was thronically christened in a divine message of 16th September 1941, and the divine structure was called the Cogent Arrangement. Ever since then, God declared His intention for the Holy Order to build a Grand Temple for Him. The dimensions were specified. The Holy Order was established by God in the same way the Creator meditated, and the resultant divine products were the heavens, earth, and the universe. Thus, God is the Founder of the GDHOTE. Let us listen to the explanation of the holy angels of God, it says: “Dateline Spring 1941 THE EMANATION OF THE THIRD ERA was established in the Name ELOHIM-MISHEN - as a final passover, restoration and initiation of the ADAMIC SOUL back to the presence of God, and in which the hidden secrets and mysteries of creation are revealed first-hand to mankind, meant to be the Glory of God’s creation in the Cosmic Empire. Due to the ever changing face of the Earth and the boundless expanse of man’s mind that is subjected to his will in retrospect, a smaller version of this Grand Ritual was instituted that the favoured ones of the black race may be in constant favour of THE ALMIGHTY GOD, through time and clime,” Tetra, Pastor, Michael the Patron. From this Angelic explanation, the GDHOTE in all ramifications is an extraordinary spiritual Citadel for human souls’ awakening in pursuance and search for divine realities. It is a divine institution of esoteric science for spiritual research and development for selfrealisation of man in the image and likeness of God. It is an advanced school for experienced souls in Christ light to have positive impact on the world of mortals.";

  "The Holy Order started from a very humble beginning, using a rented room and parlour apartment as her place of worship. They started at 13, Jebba Street, Ebute Meta West, and later moved to 33, Jones Street, Ebute Meta West. Later land was secured at Iponri village, close to Ebute Meta West. After much efforts the first Temporary Temple was built in 1961 on this land, this building is now being used as the Sabbath School. Efforts were intensified to build a more spacious and befitting place of worship, which resulted in dedicating the second Temporary Temple on 10th of August 1986. This is the present Temple we are using now; it is a three floor building. Holy Order of Saint Mary chapel is on the ground floor, the sanctuary and the body of the Temple is on the first floor, and the prayer chambers and others on the second floor. Still the command and intention of God to build a Grand Temple for Him, with His specifications is yet to be fulfilled prayer chambers and others on the second floor.
