By these words of mine, I call upon you to be a partaker of this command, and you shall live forever. I am Jesus Christ.";

  " The Great Divine Holy Order of the Third Era was thronically christened in a divine message of 16th September 1941, and the divine structure was called the Cogent Arrangement. Ever since then, God declared His intention for the Holy Order to build a Grand Temple for Him. The dimensions were specified. The Holy Order was established by God in the same way the Creator meditated, and the resultant divine products were the heavens, earth, and the universe. Thus, God is the Founder of the GDHOTE. Let us listen to the explanation of the holy angels of God, it says: “Dateline Spring 1941 THE EMANATION OF THE THIRD ERA was established in the Name ELOHIM-MISHEN - as a final passover, restoration and initiation of the ADAMIC SOUL back to the presence of God, and in which the hidden secrets and mysteries of creation are revealed first-hand to mankind, meant to be the Glory of God’s creation in the Cosmic Empire. Due to the ever changing face of the Earth and the boundless expanse of man’s mind that is subjected to his will in retrospect, a smaller version of this Grand Ritual was instituted that the favoured ones of the black race may be in constant favour of THE ALMIGHTY GOD, through time and clime,” Tetra, Pastor, Michael the Patron. From this Angelic explanation, the GDHOTE in all ramifications is an extraordinary spiritual Citadel for human souls’ awakening in pursuance and search for divine realities. It is a divine institution of esoteric science for spiritual research and development for selfrealisation of man in the image and likeness of God. It is an advanced school for experienced souls in Christ light to have positive impact on the world of mortals.";

  "The Holy Order started from a very humble beginning, using a rented room and parlour apartment as her place of worship. They started at 13, Jebba Street, Ebute Meta West, and later moved to 33, Jones Street, Ebute Meta West. Later land was secured at Iponri village, close to Ebute Meta West. After much efforts the first Temporary Temple was built in 1961 on this land, this building is now being used as the Sabbath School. Efforts were intensified to build a more spacious and befitting place of worship, which resulted in dedicating the second Temporary Temple on 10th of August 1986. This is the present Temple we are using now; it is a three floor building. Holy Order of Saint Mary chapel is on the ground floor, the sanctuary and the body of the Temple is on the first floor, and the prayer chambers and others on the second floor. Still the command and intention of God to build a Grand Temple for Him, with His specifications is yet to be fulfilled prayer chambers and others on the second floor.

  "After 30 years, the first initiative design came from a member Architect, Brother Adekoya (Uncle Yahya), when he designed the first architectural concept of the Grand Temple, showing the Holy of Holies and the body of the Temple. This design went through series of modifications. In the 80s two member architects, Brothers Bayo Adewakun and Olu Ajibola were sent on tour of Europe to visit notable churches and temples. However, it was the architectural design of Bro Ola Banwo, that was divinely chosen. In the early 90s, fund raising was embarked upon by the Rabbinical Council under the Chairmanship of Elder O. Olugbekan. Land for the GT in Iponri was pursued vigorously by the Physical Planning Committee headed by Brother Oluborode assisted by Priest A. I. Adefule. But all seemed difficult to attain, until 2004, when more land was acquired from the owner occupiers and duly compensated. The chosen architectural designs of Brother Ola Banwo were without government approval. Efforts were made to get necessary approvals in the early 2000 by the Building Committee headed by Brother V. Oluwasanmi and assisted by Priest A. I. Adefule and Brother A. Smith (who became the Chairman of the Building Committee respectively).  In 2008 the pilling contract was awarded to Trevi Construction Company, piling works were completed in 2009. The Foundation laying and Fund-Raising ceremony was done in 2010. From here, the Holy Order professionals headed by the Project Director (Bro. Ola Banwo) including the Project Manager (Bro. Adekunle Adefule), Project Accountant (Bro. Ayodokun Ogunba), Sis. Kemi Ogunnoiki (Project Storekeeper) with the support of a Structural Engineer (Engr. Adeeko) took up the construction works under the supervision of the Great Divine Rabbi O. Olugbekan (a Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers) using direct labour approach. Presently, the construction approach has been shifted from direct labour to technical professional engagement, initiated by Priest E. O. Ajuwon. The intention is to make sure that all construction works meet the specified specifications including the finishing works. To this end, the services of the following professionals were engaged: Interior Architect, Mechanical, Electrical, Acoustic, Audiovisual, Quantity Surveyor and Drainage Consultants.";

  "It is understandable that being human, we may not know the great implications of having the Grand Temple built on earth, on the Yoruba soil and in our midst. Much as the holy angels have constantly explained the advantages, the real impact is yet to set in for us to know the love of God for us, His purpose for such command, and what we will become when this edifice is finally completed. All things good do not come easy. A basic example is the encounter of Jesus Christ while on earth. A lot of obstacles came his way, to dissuade him and to make him fail, just that the purpose of his call would not have the right of place. All these, notwithstanding he stood firm, wither the storm, overcame obstructions and came out in glory. King Solomon submitted thus: “So also in this your time, a whole lot of things are linked to the seat of power, the abode where God shall reside to govern and to give judgement on all the acts of men. We ask, how would you imagine that the wicked would allow you to have this on a platter of gold? You have to labour, but your consolation is that if you labour, you are bound to have the backings of the angels of God to succeed.” Solomon.";

  "The Architect (Bro. Ola Banwo) was divinely influenced on the concept of the Grand Temple to consist of 3 parts: The Holy of Holies (The Sanctuary), The Body of the Temple (Main Worship Area) and The Soul (The Projected Roof). The Holy of Holies is somewhat outside the Body of the Temple but remains connected, while the Body also supports the Soul which projects towards heaven. The concept determined the geometry of the building, from the onset. The Holy of Holies stands apart from the Main Body of the Worship Area. A swoop roof, representing the Soul is separated from the gable-roofed Main Worship Area which represents the Body by a depressed curved skylight. The separation was followed through with tall glazing on both ends of the curved skylight. The curved roof stretches about 7-storeys high to suspend a two-and-a-half-storey high bright metal Crucifix – for all to see. With this divine concept the architectural designs evolved.";

  "“The Grand Temple is the abode of God. Being His abode, it affords you as members of the Holy Order, the closest companion and interaction with the Creator of the heavens and the earth; it shields you away from all warranted and unwarranted attacks and accusations of all enemies visible and invisible, since you practically “live” with Him here on earth; it gives you the grace to seek and to fin immediately, the love and favour of the Almighty; it confirms to you the authority of God over all things, which He has given unto you. Above all, it makes you a joint heir rulers of the entire universe. This is a great opportunity and unquantified importance of the building and usage of this divine edifice when completed. That this building is situated on the Yoruba soil is greatprivilege to the race, indicating that where God dwells, therays emanating from the Temple will keep at bay all wicked plansand intentions of everyone that opposes His will; whereGoddwells, the people of the area cannot lack any good thing; whereGod dwells, His Kingdom, yea His desired reign shall supersedeover the land. These are great blessings for the race and herpeople.  He is the Creator of all and when He comes to dwell amongst you His people, from there He rule over the entire universe, from there, your prayers for all races and colour shall receive His divine blessings; from that seat of power and authority, His Kingdom shall be firmly grounded for all to know Him and do His will, thereby making the world a better place for all to live in. His Kingdom on earth shall have it’s right of place to fulfilHis divine intentions for humanity. Gabriel.” Anael";

  "King Solomon, the builder of the first Temple of the Most High God, explained the various links associated to the completion and dedication of the Grand Temple. He said:  “When God seats on His Throne in the Grand Temple, His New Kingdom shall be directed therefrom and no power or might can question or work against it. When God seats/dwells amongst His people and the chosen race - Yoruba race, no nation, not even His earlier beloved nation Israel can compete where He resides. When God dwells amongst His people, they shall flourish in everything they lay there hands upon to do - even that which He has established - Mishenland Glory Ventures shall be a source of blessings to all humanity. You may not be able to comprehend the benefits of the completion of this edifice now, but when it becomes useful, then you shall see, know and acknowledge the goodness of the God of Mishen. It is your burning duty and desire to see to its completion.” King Solomon. MISHENITES BUILD FOR THE LORD. THIS WE SHALL DO";
